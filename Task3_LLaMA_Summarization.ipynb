Researchers at Stanford University have created panels that use radiative cooling to produce power when the sun isn't shining. The technology works by capturing infrared radiation emitted by the Earth and converting it into electricity. During testing, the panels generated 25% of their daytime output during nighttime hours. This innovation could revolutionize the solar energy industry and make renewable power more reliable and consistent. The panels are also more durable than traditional solar cells, with an expected lifespan of 30 years. Manufacturing costs are comparable to current solar panel technology, making them economically viable for widespread adoption. Several energy companies have already expressed interest in licensing the technology for commercial production.\",\n",
