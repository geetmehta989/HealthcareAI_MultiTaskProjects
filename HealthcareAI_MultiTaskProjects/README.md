# HealthcareAI_MultiTaskProjects

Three end-to-end AI/ML projects runnable in Google Colab with GPU:

- Task 1: Arrhythmia Classification Using CNN on ECG signals
- Task 2: Fine-Tune Bio_ClinicalBERT for 22-class clinical sentence classification
- Task 3: LLaMA 3.1 Text Summarization on CNN/DailyMail

## Repository Structure

- `Task1_ECG_CNN.ipynb`
- `Task2_BioClinicalBERT.ipynb`
- `Task3_LLaMA_Summarization.ipynb`
- `requirements.txt`
- `dataset_links.md`

## Running in Colab

- Open each notebook in Google Colab, set Runtime to GPU.
- Follow the first setup cell to install dependencies.
- Each notebook downloads datasets automatically (Google Drive, Kaggle, or Hugging Face).

## Notes

- For Kaggle, you will need an API token (`kaggle.json`). The notebook guides you to upload it.
- For any private Google Drive links, you may need to authenticate in Colab when prompted.
